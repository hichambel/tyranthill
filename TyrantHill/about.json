		{
		"aboutus":"The name of our organization is Tyrant HillÂ©. Our purpose is to bring a brand new wave of fashion clothing to the city of Montreal. Our company will be oriented towards streetwear. Our targeted audience is the young people of the City of Montreal, including the South Shore, who have a sense of fashion. Tyrant Hill will need a website to show the people what different products we have to offer (with pictures) and to promote our social media links. Promoting our social medias is important since this is where the young people spend all their time. Also, our company will do deliveries across Montreal so it is important for us to have a section in our website for orders."
